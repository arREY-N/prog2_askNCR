[Nursing Priority No. 1]
    - To assess etiology/precipitating contributory factors:
1. Determine the type of discomfort the client is experiencing, such as physical pain, feeling of discontent, lack of ease with self, environment, or sociocultural settings, or inability to rise above one’s problems or pain (lack of transcendence). Have the client rate total comfort, using a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being as comfortable as possible, or a “general comfort” questionnaire using a Likert- type scale. A comfort scale is similar to a pain rating scale and can help the client identify the focus of discomfort (e.g., physical, emotional, or social).
2. Note cultural/religious beliefs and values that impact perceptions and expectations of comfort.
3. Ascertain locus of control. The presence of an external locus of control may hamper efforts to achieve a sense of peace or contentment.
4. Discuss concerns with the client and active- listen to identify underlying issues (e.g., physical and emotional stressors or external factors such as environmental surroundings; social interactions) that could impact the client’s ability to control own well- being. This helps to determine the client’s specific needs and ability to change own situation.
5. Establish context(s) in which lack of comfort is realized: physical (pertaining to bodily sensations); psychospiritual (pertaining to internal awareness of self and meaning in one’s life, relationship to a higher order or being), environmental (pertaining to external surroundings, conditions, and infl uences), or sociocultural (pertaining to interpersonal, family, and societal relationships).
 - Physical
-- Determine how the client is managing pain and pain components. Lack of control may be related to other issues or emotions such as fear, loneliness, anxiety, noxious stimuli, or anger.
-- Ascertain what has been tried or is required for comfort or rest (e.g., head of bed up/down, music on/off, white noise, rocking motion, or a certain person or thing).
 - Psychospiritual
-- Determine how psychological and spiritual indicators overlap (e.g., meaningfulness, faith, identity, and self- esteem) for the client. 
-- Ascertain if the client/signifi cant other (SO) desires support regarding spiritual enrichment, including prayer, meditation, or access to a spiritual counselor of choice.
 - Environmental
-- Determine that the client’s environment both respects privacy and provides natural lighting with readily accessible view to outdoors— an aspect that can be manipulated to enhance comfort.
 - Sociocultural
-- Ascertain the meaning of comfort in the context of interpersonal, family, cultural values, and societal relationships.
-- Validate client/SO understanding of client’s situation and ongoing methods of managing condition, as appropriate and/ or desired by client. This considers client/family needs in this area and/or shows appreciation for their desires

    -  To assist client to alleviate discomfort:
1. Review knowledge base and note coping skills that have been used previously to change behavior/promote well- being. This brings these to client’s awareness and promotes use in the current situation.
2. Acknowledge the client’s strengths in the present situation and build on these in planning for the future.
    - Physical
-- Collaborate in treating or managing medical conditions involving oxygenation, elimination, mobility, cognitive abilities, electrolyte balance, thermoregulation, and hydration to promote physical stability.
-- Work with the client to prevent pain, nausea, itching, and thirst/other physical discomforts.
-- Review medications or treatment regimen to determine possible changes or options to reduce side effects.
-- Suggest that the parent be present during procedures to comfort child.
-- Provide age- appropriate comfort measures (e.g., back rub, change of position, cuddling, and use of heat/cold) to provide nonpharmacological pain management.
-- Discuss interventions/activities such as Therapeutic Touch (TT), massage, healing touch, biofeedback, self- hypnosis, guided imagery, and breathing exercises; play therapy; and humor to promote ease and relaxation and to refocus attention.
-- Assist the client to use and modify medication regimen to make the best use of pharmacological pain or symptom management.
-- Assist the client/SO(s) to develop a plan for activity and exercise within individual ability, emphasizing the necessity of allowing suffi cient time to fi nish activities.
-- Maintain open and fl exible visitation with client’s desired persons.
-- Encourage/plan care to allow individually adequate rest periods to prevent fatigue. Schedule activities for periods when the client has the most energy to maximize participation.
-- Discuss routines to promote restful sleep.
    - Psychospiritual
-- Interact with the client in a therapeutic manner. The nurse could be the most important comfort intervention for meeting client’s needs. For example, assuring the client that nausea can be treated successfully with both pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods may be more effective than simply administering an antiemetic without reassurance and a comforting presence.
-- Encourage verbalization of feelings and make time for listening/interacting.
-- Identify ways (e.g., meditation, sharing oneself with others, being out in nature/garden, other spiritual activities) to achieve connectedness or harmony with self, others, nature, or a higher power.
-- Establish realistic activity goals with the client. This enhances commitment to promoting optimal outcomes.
-- Involve the client/SO(s) in schedule planning and decisions about timing and spacing of treatments to promote relaxation/reduce sense of boredom.
-- Encourage the client to do whatever possible (e.g., self- care, sit up in chair, or walk). This enhances self- esteem and independence.
-- Use age- appropriate distraction with music, reading, chatting, or texting with family and friends, watching TV or movies, or playing video or computer games to limit dwelling on and transcend unpleasant sensations and situations.
-- Encourage the client to develop assertiveness skills, prioritizing goals/activities, and to make use of benefi cial coping behaviors. This promotes a sense of control and improves self- esteem.
-- Identify opportunities for the client to participate in experiences that enhance control and independence.
    - Environmental
-- Provide a quiet environment, calm activities. 
-- Provide for periodic changes in the personal surroundings when the client is confi ned. Use the individual’s input in creating the changes (e.g., seasonal bulletin boards, color changes, rearranging furniture, or pictures). This promotes a client’s sense of self- control and environmental comfort.
-- Suggest activities, such as bird feeders or baths for birdwatching, a garden in a window box/terrarium, or a fi sh bowl/ aquarium, to stimulate observation as well as involvement and participation in activity.
    - Sociocultural
-- Encourage age- appropriate diversional activities (e.g., TV/ radio, computer games, play time, or socialization/outings with others).
-- Avoid overstimulation/understimulation (cognitive and sensory).
-- Make appropriate referrals to available support groups, hobby clubs, and service organizations.

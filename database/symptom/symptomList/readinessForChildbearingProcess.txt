::Action/Interventions::
[Nursing Priority No. 1]
    - To determine individual needs:
 Prenatal
1. Evaluate current knowledge and cultural beliefs regarding normal physiological and psychological changes of pregnancy, as well as beliefs about activities, self- care, and so on.
2. Determine the degree of motivation for learning. The client may have diffi culty learning unless the need for it is clear.
3. Identify who provides support/instruction within the client’s culture (e.g., grandmother/other family member, cueranderadoula, or other cultural healer). Work with the support person(s) when possible, using an interpreter as needed. This helps ensure quality and continuity of care because the support person(s) may be more successful than the healthcare provider in communicating information.
4. Determine the client’s commitments to work, family, community, and self; roles/responsibilities within family unit; and use of supportive resources. This helps in setting realistic priorities to assist the client in making adjustments, such as changing work hours, shifting household chores, and curtailing some outside commitments.
5. Evaluate the client’s/couple’s response to pregnancy, individual and family stressors, and cultural implications of pregnancy/childbirth. The ability to adapt positively depends on support systems, cultural beliefs, resources, and effective coping mechanisms developed in dealing with past stressors.
6. Determine the client’s/couple’s perception of the fetus as a separate entity and the extent of preparations being made for this infant. Activities such as choosing a name or nicknaming the baby in utero and home preparations indicate completion of psychological tasks of pregnancy. Note: Cultural or familial beliefs may limit visible preparations out of concern that a bad outcome might result.
7. Assess the client’s economic situation and fi nancial needs in order to make necessary referrals.
8. Determine usual pregravid weight and dietary patterns. Research studies have found a positive correlation between pregravid maternal obesity and increased perinatal morbidity rates (e.g., hypertension and gestational diabetes) associated with preterm births and macrosomia.
 Labor and Delivery
-- Ascertain the client’s understanding and expectations of the labor process. The client’s/couple’s coping skills are most challenged during the active and transition phases as contractions become increasingly intense. Lack of knowledge, misconceptions, or unrealistic expectations can have a negative impact on coping abilities.
-- Review the birth plan developed by the client/partner. Note cultural expectations and preferences. This verifi es that choices made are amenable to the specifi c care setting, accommodate individual wishes, and refl ect client/fetal status.
 Postpartum/Newborn Care
-- Determine the plan for discharge after delivery and home care support/needs. Early planning can facilitate discharge and help ensure that client/infant needs will be met.
-- Ascertain the client’s perception of labor and delivery, length of labor, and client’s fatigue level. There is a correlation between length of labor and the ability of some clients to assume responsibility for self- care/infant care tasks and activities.
-- Assess the mother’s strengths and needs, noting age, marital status/relationship, presence and reaction of siblings and other family members, available sources of support, and cultural background. This identifi es potential risk factors and sources of support, which infl uence the client’s/couple’s ability to assume the role of parenthood. For example, an adolescent still formulating goals and an identity may have diffi culty accepting the infant as a person. The single parent who lacks support systems may have diffi culty assuming sole responsibility for parenting.
-- Appraise the level of parent’s understanding of infant’s physiological needs and adaptation to extrauterine life associated with maintenance of body temperature, nutrition, respiratory needs, and bowel and bladder functioning. 
-- Evaluate the nature of emotional and physical parenting that client/couple received during their childhood. The parenting role is learned, and individuals use their own parents as role models. Those who experienced a negative upbringing or poor parenting may require additional support to meet the challenges of effective parenting.
-- Note the father’s/partner’s response to birth and to the parenting role. The client’s ability to adapt positively to parenting may be strongly infl uenced by the father’s/partner’s reaction.
-- Assess the client’s readiness and motivation for learning. Assist the client/couple in identifying needs. The postpartal period provides an opportunity to foster maternal growth, maturation, and competence.

    - To promote maximum participation in the childbearing process:
 Prenatal
-- Maintain an open attitude toward the beliefs of the client/
couple. Acceptance is important to developing and maintaining relationships and supporting independence.
-- Explain the office visit routine, and the rationale for ongoing screening and close monitoring (e.g., urine testing, blood pressure monitoring, weight, and fetal growth). Emphasize the importance of keeping regular appointments. This reinforces the relationship between health assessment and positive outcome for mother and baby.
-- Suggest that father and siblings attend prenatal offi ce visits and listen to fetal heart tones (FHTs) as appropriate. This promotes a sense of involvement and helps make the baby a reality for family members.
-- Provide information about need for additional laboratory studies, diagnostic tests, or procedure(s). Review risks and potential side effects.
-- Discuss any medications that may be needed to control or treat medical conditions. Helpful in choosing treatment options because need must be weighed against possible harmful effects on the fetus.
-- Provide anticipatory guidance, including discussion of nutrition, regular moderate exercise, comfort measures, rest, employment, breast care, sexual activity, and health habits/ lifestyle. Information encourages acceptance of responsibility and promotes self- care:
 Review nutrition requirements and optimal prenatal weight gain to support maternal- fetal needs. Inadequate prenatal weight gain and/or below normal prepregnancy weight increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in the fetus and delivery of a low- birth- weight (LBW) infant.
 Encourage moderate exercise such as walking, or nonweight- bearing activities (e.g., swimming or bicycling) in accordance with the client’s physical condition and cultural beliefs. This tends to shorten labor, increases the likelihood of a spontaneous vaginal delivery, and decreases the need for oxytocin augmentation.
 Recommend a consistent sleep and rest schedule (e.g., 1- to 2- hr daytime nap and 8 hr of sleep each night) in a dark, comfortable room.
 Identify anticipatory adaptations for signifi cant other (SO)/ family necessitated by pregnancy. Family members will need to be fl exible in adjusting their own roles and responsibilities in order to assist the client to meet her needs related to the demands of pregnancy.
 Provide/reinforce information about potential teratogens, such as alcohol, nicotine, illicit drugs, the STORCH group of viruses (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex), and HIV. This helps the client make informed decisions/choices about behaviors/ environment that can promote healthy offspring. Note: Research supports the attribution of a wide range of negative effects in the neonate to alcohol, recreational drug use, and smoking.
2. Use various methods for learning, including pictures, to discuss fetal development. Visualization enhances the reality of the child and strengthens the learning process.
3. Discuss the signs of labor onset, how to distinguish between false and true labor, when to notify the healthcare provider and to leave for the hospital/birth center, and stages of labor/ delivery. Helps ensure timely arrival and enhances coping with the labor/delivery process.
4. Review signs/symptoms requiring evaluation by the primary provider during the prenatal period (e.g., excessive vomiting, fever, unresolved illness of any kind, and decreased fetal movement). This allows for timely intervention.
 Labor and Delivery
-- Identify the client’s support person/coach and ascertain that the individual is providing support that the client requires. The coach may be the client’s husband/SO or doula, and support can take the form of physical and emotional support for the mother and aid in initiation of bonding with the neonate.
-- Demonstrate or review behaviors and techniques (e.g., breathing, focused imagery, music, other distractions; aromatherapy; abdominal effl eurage, back or leg rubs, sacral pressure, repositioning, and back rest; oral and perineal care and linen changes; and shower/hot tub use) that the partner can use to assist with pain control and relaxation.
-- Discuss available analgesics, usual responses and side effects (client and fetal), and duration of analgesic effect in light of current situation. This allows the client to make an informed choice about the means of pain control; this can allay the client’s fears and anxieties about medication use.
-- Support the client’s decision about the use or nonuse of medication in a nonjudgmental manner. Continue encouragement for efforts and use of relaxation techniques. Enhances the client’s sense of control and may prevent or decrease the need for medication.
 Postpartum/Newborn Care
-- Initiate early breastfeeding or oral feeding according to hospital protocol. Initial feeding for breastfed infants usually occurs in the delivery room. Otherwise, 5 to 15 mL of sterile water may be offered in the nursery to assess the effectiveness of sucking, swallowing, gag refl exes, and patency of esophagus.
-- Note frequency, amount, and length of feedings. Encourage demand feedings instead of scheduled feedings. Note frequency, amount, and appearance of regurgitation. Hunger and length of time between feedings vary from feeding to feeding, and excessive regurgitation increases replacement needs.
-- Evaluate neonate and maternal satisfaction following feedings. This provides the opportunity to answer client questions, offer encouragement for efforts, identify needs, and problem- solve situations.
-- Demonstrate and supervise infant care activities related to feeding and holding; bathing, diapering, and clothing; care of circumcised male infant; and care of umbilical cord stump. Provide written/pictorial information for parents to refer to after discharge.
-- Provide information about newborn interactional capabilities, states of consciousness, and means of stimulating cognitive development. This helps parents recognize and respond to infant cues during an interactional process, and fosters optimal interaction, attachment behaviors, and cognitive development in infant.
-- Promote sleep and rest. This reduces the metabolic rate and allows nutrition and oxygen to be used for the healing process rather than for energy needs.
-- Provide for unlimited participation for father and siblings. Ascertain whether siblings attended an orientation program. This facilitates family development and the ongoing process of acquaintance and attachment.
-- Monitor and document the client’s/couple’s interactions with the infant. Note the presence of bonding or acquaintance behaviors (e.g., making eye contact, using high- pitched voice and en face [face- to- face] position as culturally appropriate, calling the infant by name, and holding the infant closely).

    - To enhance optimal well- being:
 Prenatal
-- Emphasize the importance of maternal well- being. Fetal well- being is directly related to maternal well- being, especially during the fi rst trimester, when developing organ systems are most vulnerable to injury from environmental or hereditary factors.
-- Review physical changes to be expected during each trimester. This prepares the client/couple for managing common discomforts associated with pregnancy.
-- Explain psychological reactions including ambivalence, introspection, stress reactions, and emotional lability as characteristic of pregnancy. This helps the client/couple understand mood swings and may provide opportunities for the partner to offer support and affection at these times.
-- Provide necessary referrals (e.g., dietitian, social services, food stamps, or Women, Infants, and Children [WIC] food programs) as indicated. A supplemental federally funded food program helps promote optimal maternal, fetal, and infant nutrition.
-- Review reportable danger signals of pregnancy, such as bleeding, cramping, acute abdominal pain, backache, edema, visual disturbance, headaches, and pelvic pressure. This helps the client distinguish normal from abnormal fi ndings, thus assisting her in seeking timely, appropriate healthcare.
-- Encourage attendance at prenatal and childbirth classes. Provide information about father/sibling or grandparent participation in classes and delivery if the client desires. Knowledge gained helps reduce fear of unknown and increases confi dence that couple can manage the preparation for the birth of their child. Helps family members to realize they are an integral part of the pregnancy and delivery.
-- Provide a list of appropriate reading materials for client, couple, and siblings regarding adjusting to a newborn. Information helps the individual realistically analyze changes in family structure, roles, and behaviors.
 Labor and Delivery
-- Monitor labor progress and maternal and fetal well- being per protocol. Provide continuous intrapartal professional support/ doula. Fear of abandonment can intensify as labor progresses, and the client may experience increased anxiety and/or loss of control when left unattended.
-- Reinforce the use of positive coping mechanisms. This enhances feelings of competence and fosters self- esteem.
 Postpartum/Newborn Care
-- Provide information about self- care, including perineal care and hygiene; physiological changes, including normal progression of lochial discharge; need for sleep and rest; importance of progressive postpartal exercise program; and role changes. Fosters healing and recuperation, and contributes to positive adaptation to physical and emotional changes enhancing feelings of general well- being.
-- Review normal psychological changes and needs associated with the postpartal period. The client’s emotional state may be somewhat labile at this time and often is infl uenced by physical well- being.
-- Discuss sexuality needs and plans for contraception. Provide information about a vailable methods, including advantages and disadvantages.
-- Reinforce the importance of postpartal examination by healthcare provider and interim follow- up as appropriate. Follow- up visit is necessary to evaluate the recovery of reproductive organs, healing of episiotomy/laceration repair, general well- being, and adaptation to life changes.
-- Provide oral and written information about infant care and development, feeding, and safety issues.
-- Offer appropriate references refl ecting cultural beliefs.
-- Discuss the physiology and benefits of breastfeeding, nipple and breast care, special dietary needs, factors that facilitate or interfere with successful breastfeeding, use of breast pump, and appropriate suppliers. This helps ensure an adequate milk supply, prevents nipple cracking and soreness, facilitates comfort, and establishes the role of the breastfeeding mother.
-- Refer the client to support groups (e.g., La Leche League or Lact-Aid) or lactation consultant to promote a successful breastfeeding outcome.
-- Identify available community resources as indicated (e.g., WIC program). WIC and other federal programs support well- being through client education and enhanced nutritional intake for the infant.
-- Discuss normal variations and characteristics of the infant, such as caput succedaneum, cephalohematoma, pseudomenstruation, breast enlargement, physiological jaundice, and milia. This helps parents recognize normal variations and may reduce anxiety.
-- Emphasize the newborn’s need for follow- up evaluation by the healthcare provider and timely immunizations.
-- Identify manifestations of illness and infection and the times at which a healthcare provider should be contacted. Demonstrate the proper technique for taking temperature, administering oral medications, or providing other care activities for infant as required. Early recognition of illness and prompt use of healthcare facilitate treatment and positive outcome.
-- Refer the client/couple to community postpartal parent groups. This increases the parent’s knowledge of child rearing and child development and provides a supportive atmosphere while parents incorporate new roles.

::Action/Interventions::

[Nursing Priority No. 1]
    -  To determine causative or risk factors and individual needs:
 Prenatal Concerns
1. Determine maternal health/nutritional status, usual pregravid weight, and dietary pattern. Research studies have found a positive correlation between pregravid maternal obesity and increased perinatal morbidity rates (e.g., hypertension and gestational diabetes) associated with preterm births and macrosomia.
2. Note use of alcohol/other drugs and nicotine. Maternal pregnancy complications and negative effects on the developing fetus are increased with the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. Note: Prescription medications may also be dangerous to the fetus, requiring a risk/benefi t analysis for therapeutic choices and appropriate dosage.
3. Evaluate current knowledge regarding physiological and psychological changes associated with pregnancy. This provides information to assist in identifying needs and creating an individual plan of care.
4. Identify involvement/response of child’s father to pregnancy. This helps clarify whether or not the father is likely to be supportive or has the potential of posing a threat to the safety and well- being of mother/fetus.
5. Determine individual family stressors, economic situation/ financial needs, and availability/use of resources to identify necessary referrals. Impact of pregnancy on family with limited resources can create added stress and result in limited prenatal care and preparation for newborn.
6. Verify environmental well- being and safety of client/family. Women experiencing intimate partner violence both prior to and/or during pregnancy are at higher risk for multiple poor maternal and infant health outcomes.
7. Determine cultural expectations/beliefs about childbearing, self- care, and so on. Identify who provides support/instruction within the client’s culture (e.g., grandmother/other family member, cuerandero/doula, or other cultural healer). Work with support person(s) as desired by the client, using an interpreter as needed. This helps ensure quality and continuity of care because support person(s) can reinforce information provided.
8. Ascertain the client’s commitments to work, family, and self; roles/responsibilities within family unit; and use of supportive resources. This helps in setting realistic priorities to assist the client in making adjustments, such as changing work hours, shifting household chores, curtailing some outside commitments.
9. Determine the client’s/couple’s perception of the fetus as a separate entity and extent of preparations being made for this infant. The absence of activities such as choosing a name or nicknaming the baby in utero and home preparations indicate lack of completion of psychological tasks of pregnancy. Note: Cultural or familial beliefs may limit visible preparations out of concern that a bad outcome might result.
 Labor and Delivery Concerns
-- Ascertain the client’s understanding and expectations of the labor process and who will participate/provide support. The client’s/couple’s coping skills are more challenged during the active and transitional phases as contractions become increasingly intense. Lack of knowledge, misconceptions, or unrealistic expectations can have a negative impact on coping abilities.
-- Determine the presence/appropriateness of the birth plan developed by the client/couple and any associated cultural expectations/preferences. This identifi es areas to address to ensure that choices made are amenable to the specifi c care setting, refl ect reality of client/fetal status, and accommodate individual wishes.
 Postpartum/Newborn Care Concerns
-- Determine the plan for discharge after delivery and home care support/needs. This is important to facilitate discharge and ensure client/infant needs will be met.
-- Appraise the level of the parent’s understanding of physiological needs and adaptation to extrauterine life associated with maintenance of body temperature, nutrition, respiratory needs, and bowel and bladder functioning. This identifi es areas of concern/need requiring development of a teaching plan and/or demonstration of care activities.
-- Assess the mother’s strengths and needs, noting age, relationship status, and reactions of family members. This identifi es potential risk factors that may infl uence the client’s/couple’s ability to assume the role of parenthood. For example, an adolescent still formulating goals and identity may have diffi culty accepting the infant as a person. The single parent who lacks support systems may have diffi culty assuming sole responsibility for parenting.
-- Ascertain the nature of emotional and physical parenting that the client/couple received during their childhood. The parenting role is learned, and individuals use their own parents as role models. Those who experienced a negative upbringing or poor parenting may require additional support to meet the challenges of effective parenting.

    - To promote optimal maternal well- being:
 Prenatal
1. Emphasize the importance of maternal well- being, including discussion of nutrition, regular moderate exercise, comfort measures, rest, breast care, and sexual activity. Fetal wellbeing is directly related to maternal health, especially during the fi rst trimester, when developing organ systems are most vulnerable to injury from environmental or hereditary factors:
 Review nutrition requirements and optimal prenatal weight gain to support maternal- fetal needs. Inadequate prenatal weight gain and/or below normal prepregnancy weight increases the risk of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in the fetus and delivery of a low- birth- weight (LBW) infant.
 Encourage moderate exercise such as walking or non- weightbearing activities (e.g., swimming, bicycling) in accordance with the client’s physical condition and cultural beliefs. Exercise tends to shorten labor, increases likelihood of a spontaneous vaginal delivery, and decreases need for oxytocin augmentation.
 Recommend a consistent sleep and rest schedule (e.g., 1- to 2- hour daytime nap and 8 hours of sleep each night) in a dark, comfortable room. This provides rest to meet metabolic needs associated with growth of maternal and fetal tissues.
2. Provide necessary referrals (e.g., dietitian, social services, supplemental nutrition assistance programs) as indicated. Federal/state food programs promote optimal maternal, fetal, and infant nutrition.
3. Encourage participation in smoking cessation program, alcohol/ drug abstinence as appropriate. This reduces the risk of premature birth, stillbirth, low birth weight, congenital defects, drug withdrawal of newborn, and fetal alcohol syndrome.
4. Explain psychological reactions including ambivalence, introspection, stress reactions, and emotional lability as characteristic of pregnancy. Helps client/couple understand mood swings and may provide opportunity for partner to offer support and affection at these times. Note: The stressors associated with pregnancy can lead to abuse or exacerbate existing abusive behavior.
5. Discuss personal situation and options, providing information about resources available to client. The partner may be upset about an unplanned pregnancy, have fi nancial concerns regarding supporting the child, or may even be jealous that attention is shifting to the unborn child, creating safety issues for client/family.
6. Identify reportable potential danger signals of pregnancy, such as bleeding, cramping, acute abdominal pain, backache, edema, visual disturbances, headaches, and pelvic pressure. This helps the client distinguish normal from abnormal fi ndings, thus assisting her in seeking timely, appropriate healthcare. (Refer to ND risk for disturbed Maternal-Fetal Dyad for additional interventions.)
 Labor and Delivery
-- Monitor labor progress and maternal and fetal well- being per protocol. Provide continuous intrapartal professional support/ doula. Fear of abandonment can intensify as labor progresses, and client may experience increased anxiety and/ or loss of control when left unattended.
-- Identify the client’s support person/coach and ascertain that the individual is providing support the client requires. The coach may be the client’s husband/signifi cant other (SO) or doula and needs to provide physical and emotional support for the mother and aid in initiation of bonding with the neonate.
 Postpartum
-- Promote sleep and rest. This reduces the metabolic rate and allows energy and oxygen to be used for the healing process.
-- Ascertain the client’s perception of labor and delivery, length of labor, and fatigue level. There is a correlation between length of labor and the ability of some clients to assume responsibility for self- care/infant- care tasks and activities.
-- Assess the client’s readiness for learning. Assist the client in identifying needs. The postpartum period provides an opportunity to foster maternal growth, maturation, and competence.
-- Provide information about self- care, including perineal care and hygiene; physiological changes, including normal progression of lochial flow; needs for sleep and rest; importance of progressive postpartum exercise program; and role changes. This helps prevent infection, fosters healing and recuperation, and contributes to positive adaptation to physical and emotional changes, enhancing feelings of general well- being.
-- Review nipple and breast care, special dietary needs for lactating mother, factors that facilitate or interfere with successful breastfeeding, use of breast pump and appropriate suppliers, proper storage of expressed milk or preparation/ storage of formula, as indicated. This prevents nipple cracking and soreness, enhancing comfort, facilitates role of breastfeeding mother, and helps ensure an adequate milk supply.
-- Discuss normal psychological changes and needs associated with the postpartal period. The client’s emotional state may be somewhat labile at this time and often is infl uenced by physical well- being. Anticipating such changes may reduce the stress associated with this transition period that necessitates learning new roles and taking on new responsibilities.
-- Discuss sexuality needs and plans for contraception. Provide information about available methods, including advantages/disadvantages. Client/couple may need clarifi cation regarding available contraception methods and the fact that pregnancy could occur even prior to the 4- to 6- week postpartum visit.
-- Reinforce the importance of postpartum examination by a healthcare provider and interim follow- up as appropriate. A follow- up visit is necessary to evaluate recovery of reproductive organs, healing of episiotomy/ laceration repair, general well- being, and adaptation to life changes. 

[Nursing Priority No.3]
    - To promote appropriate participation in childbearing process:
 Prenatal
1. Develop nurse– client relationship and maintain an open attitude toward beliefs of the client/couple. Acceptance is important to developing and maintaining a relationship and supporting independence.
2. Explain offi ce visit routine and rationale for ongoing screening and close monitoring (e.g., urine testing, blood pressure monitoring, weight, fetal growth). Emphasize the importance of keeping regular appointments. This reinforces the relationship between health assessment and positive outcomes for mother and baby.
3. Suggest father/siblings attend offi ce visits and listen to fetal heart tones (FHTs) as appropriate. This promotes a sense of involvement and helps make baby a reality for family members.
4. Provide anticipatory guidance regarding health habits/lifestyle and employment concerns:
-- Review physical changes to be expected during each trimester. Prepares client/couple for managing common discomforts associated with pregnancy.
-- Discuss signs/symptoms requiring evaluation by primary provider during prenatal period (e.g., excessive vomiting, fever, unresolved illness of any kind, and decreased fetal movement). This allows for timely intervention.
-- Identify anticipatory adaptations for SO/family necessitated by pregnancy. Family members will need to be fl exible in adjusting own roles and responsibilities in order to assist client to meet her needs related to the demands of pregnancy.
-- Provide information about potential teratogens, such as alcohol, nicotine, illicit drugs, the STORCH group of viruses (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytomegalovirus [CMV], herpes simplex), and HIV. This helps the client make informed decisions/choices about behaviors/ environment that can promote healthy offspring. Note: Research supports the attribution of a wide range of negative effects in the neonate to alcohol, recreational drug use, and smoking.
5. Provide information about the need for additional laboratory studies, diagnostic tests, or procedure(s). Review risks and potential side effects to facilitate the decision- making process.
6. Discuss signs of labor onset, how to distinguish between false and true labor, when to notify healthcare provider, and when to leave for birth center/hospital as appropriate; and stages of labor and delivery. This helps ensure timely arrival and enhances coping with the labor/delivery process.
7. Determine anticipated infant feeding plan. Discuss physiology and benefi ts of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding provides a protective effect against respiratory illnesses, ear infections, gastrointestinal diseases, and allergies including asthma, eczema, and atopic dermatitis.
8. Encourage attendance at prenatal and childbirth classes. Provide information about father/sibling or grandparent participation in classes and delivery if client desires. Knowledge gained helps reduce fear of the unknown and increases confi dence that client/couple can manage the preparation for the birth of their child. This helps family members to realize they are an integral part of the pregnancy and delivery.
 Labor and Delivery
-- Support use of positive coping mechanisms. This enhances feelings of competence and fosters self- esteem.
-- Demonstrate behaviors and techniques (e.g., breathing, focused imagery, music, other distractions; aromatherapy; abdominal effl eurage, back or leg rubs, sacral pressure, repositioning, back rest; oral care, linen changes, shower/tub use) that a partner can use to assist with pain control and relaxation.
-- Discuss available analgesics, appropriate timing, usual responses and side effects (client and fetal), and duration of analgesia effect in light of the current situation. This allows the client to make informed choices about means of pain control and can allay the client’s fears and anxieties about medication use.
-- Honor the client’s decision about the use or nonuse of medication in a nonjudgmental manner. Continue encouragement for efforts and use of relaxation techniques. This enhances the client’s sense of control and may prevent or reduce the need for medication.
 After Birth
-- Monitor and document the client’s/couple’s interactions with the infant. The presence of bonding acquaintance behaviors (e.g., making eye contact, using a high- pitched voice and en face [face- to- face] position as culturally appropriate, calling infant by name, and holding infant closely) are indicators of beginning attachment process.
-- Initiate early breastfeeding or oral feeding according to facility protocol and client preference. Initiating feeding for breastfed infants usually occurs in the delivery room. Otherwise, 5 to 15 mL of sterile water may be offered in the nursery to assess effectiveness of sucking, swallowing, gag refl exes, and patency of esophagus.
-- Provide for unlimited participation of father and siblings. Ascertain whether siblings attended orientation program. This facilitates family development and ongoing processof acquaintance.

[Nursing Priority No. 4]
    - To promote optimal well- being of newborn (Teaching/ Discharge Considerations):
1. Provide information about newborn interactional capabilities, states of consciousness, and means of stimulating cognitive development. This helps parents recognize and respond to infant cues during interactional process and fosters optimal interaction, attachment behaviors, and cognitive development in the infant.
2. Note the father’s/partner’s response to birth and to the parenting role. The client’s ability to adapt positively to parenting may be strongly infl uenced by the partner’s reaction.
3. Discuss normal variations and characteristics of the infant, such as caput succedaneum, cephalohematoma, pseudomenstruation, breast enlargement, physiological jaundice, and mlia. This helps parents recognize normal variations and may reduce anxiety.
4. Demonstrate/supervise infant care activities related to feeding and holding; bathing, diapering, and clothing; care of umbilical cord stump; and care of circumcised male infant. This promotes an understanding of the principles and techniques of newborn care, fosters parents’ skills as caregivers, and enhances self- confi dence.
5. Note the frequency, amount, and length of feedings. Encourage demand feedings instead of scheduled feedings. Note frequency, amount, and appearance of regurgitation. Hunger and length of time between feedings vary from feeding to feeding, and excessive regurgitation increases replacement needs.
6. Evaluate neonate and maternal satisfaction following feedings. This provides an opportunity to answer client questions, offer encouragement for efforts, identify needs, and problem- solve situations.
7. Appraise the level of parent’s understanding of physiological needs and adaptation to extrauterine life associated with maintenance of body temperature, nutrition, respiratory needs, and bowel and bladder functioning.
8. Emphasize the newborn’s need for follow- up laboratory tests, regular evaluations by the healthcare provider, and timely immunizations.
9. Identify manifestations of illness and infection and when to contact healthcare provider. Demonstrate proper technique for taking temperature, administering oral medication, or providing other care activities for the infant as required. Early recognition of illness and prompt use of healthcare facilitate timely treatment and positive outcomes.
10. Provide oral and written/pictorial information and reliable Web sites about infant care and development, feeding, and safety issues. Offer appropriate resources in client’s dominant language and refl ecting cultural beliefs. This maximizes learning, providing the opportunity to review information as needed.
11. Refer the breastfeeding client to a lactation consultant/support group (e.g., La Leche League, Lact-Aid) to promote a successful breastfeeding outcome.
12. Discuss available community support groups/parenting class as indicated. This increases the parents’ knowledge of child rearing and child development and provides a supportive atmosphere, while parents incorporate new roles.

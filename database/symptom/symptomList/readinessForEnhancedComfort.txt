[Nursing Priority No. 1]
    -  To determine current level of comfort and motivation for
change:
1. Note cultural or religious beliefs and values that impact perceptions of comfort.
2. Determine the type of comfort client is experiencing: (1) relief (as from pain), (2) ease (a state of calm or contentment), or (3) transcendence (a state in which one rises above one’s problems or pain).
3. Ascertain motivation or expectations for improvement. Motivation to improve and high expectations can encourage client to make changes that will improve his or her life. However, presence of external locus of control or unrealistic expectations may hamper efforts.
4. Discuss concerns with client and active- listen to identify underlying issues (e.g., physical or emotional stressors; external factors such as environmental surroundings, social interactions) that could impact client’s ability to control own well- being. Helps to determine client’s level of satisfaction with current situation and readiness for change.
5. Establish context(s) in which comfort is realized: (1) physical (pertaining to bodily sensations), (2) psychospiritual (pertaining to internal awareness of self and meaning in one’s life, relationship to a higher order or being), (3) environmental (pertaining to external surroundings, conditions, and infl uences), and (4) sociocultural (pertaining to interpersonal, family, and societal relationships).
 Physical
-- Verify that the client is managing pain and pain components effectively. Success in this area usually addresses other issues and emotions (e.g., fear, loneliness, anxiety, noxious stimuli, or anger).
-- Ascertain what is used or required for comfort or rest (e.g., head of bed up or down, music on or off, white noise, rocking motion, certain person or thing, or ability to express and/or manage confl icts).
 Psychospiritual
-- Determine how psychological and spiritual indicators overlap (e.g., meaningfulness, faith, identity, or self- esteem) for a client in enhancing comfort.
-- Determine the infl uence of cultural beliefs and values.
-- Ascertain that the client/signifi cant other (SO) has received desired support regarding spiritual enrichment, including prayer, meditation, and access to a spiritual counselor of choice.
 Environmental
-- Determine that the client’s environment respects privacy and provides natural lighting and a readily accessible view to the outdoors (an aspect that can be manipulated to enhance comfort).
 Sociocultural
-- Ascertain the meaning of comfort in the context of interpersonal, family, cultural values, spatial, and societal relationships.
-- Validate client/SO understanding of client’s diagnosis and prognosis and ongoing methods of managing condition, as appropriate and/or desired by client. This considers client/ family needs in this area and/or shows appreciation for their desires.

    - To assist client in developing plan to improve comfort:
1. Review knowledge base and note coping skills that have been used previously to change behavior and promote well- being. This brings these to the client’s awareness and promotes use in the current situation.
2. Acknowledge the client’s strengths in the present situation that can be used to build on in planning for the future.
 Physical
-- Collaborate in treating and managing medical conditions involving oxygenation, elimination, mobility, cognitive abilities, electrolyte balance, thermoregulation, and hydration to promote physical stability.
-- Work with the client to prevent pain, nausea, itching, thirst, or other physical discomforts.
-- Suggest that the parent be present during procedures to comfort the child.
-- Suggest age- appropriate comfort measures (e.g., back rub, change of position, cuddling, or the use of heat/cold) to provide nonpharmacological pain management.
-- Review interventions and activities such as therapeutic touch, biofeedback, self- hypnosis, guided imagery, breathing exercises, play therapy, and humor that promote ease and relaxation, and can refocus attention.
-- Assist the client to use or modify the medication regimen to make the best use of pharmacological pain management.
-- Assist the client/SO(s) to develop or modify the plan for activity and exercise within individual ability, emphasizing the necessity of allowing suffi cient time to fi nish activities.
-- Maintain open and fl exible visitation with client’s desired persons.
-- Encourage adequate rest periods to prevent fatigue.
-- Plan care to allow individually adequate rest periods. Schedule activities for periods when the client has the most energy to maximize participation.
-- Discuss routines to promote restful sleep.
 Psychospiritual
-- Interact with the client in a therapeutic manner. The nurse could be the most important comfort intervention for meeting the client’s needs. For example, assuring the client that nausea can be treated successfully with both pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods may be more effective than simply administering an antiemetic without reassurance and comforting presence.
-- Encourage verbalization of feelings and make time for listening and interacting.
-- Identify ways (e.g., meditation, sharing oneself with others, being out in nature/garden, or other spiritual activities) to achieve connectedness or harmony with self, others, nature, or a higher power.
-- Establish realistic activity goals with client. This enhances a commitment to promoting optimal outcomes.
-- Involve the client/SO(s) in schedule planning and decisions about timing and spacing of treatments to promote relaxation and involvement in plan.
-- Encourage the client to do whatever possible (e.g., self- care, sit up in chair, walk, etc.). This enhances self- esteem and independence.
-- Use age- appropriate distraction with music, chatting, or texting with family and friends, watching TV, or playing video or computer games to limit dwelling on or transcend unpleasant sensations and situations.
-- Encourage the client to make use of benefi cial coping behaviors and assertiveness skills, prioritizing goals and activities. This promotes a sense of control and improves self- esteem.
-- Offer or identify opportunities for the client to participate in experiences that enhance control and independence.
 Environmental
-- Provide a quiet environment and calm activities.
-- Provide for periodic changes in the personal surroundings when the client is confi ned. Use the individual’s input in creating the changes (e.g., seasonal bulletin boards, color changes, rearranging furniture, or pictures). This enhances a sense of comfort and control over the environment.
-- Suggest activities, such as bird feeders or baths for birdwatching, a garden in a window box/terrarium, or a fi sh bowl/ aquarium, to stimulate observation as well as involvement and participation in activity.
 Sociocultural
-- Encourage age- appropriate diversional activities (e.g., TV/ radio, play time/games, or socialization/outings with others).
-- Avoid cognitive or sensory overstimulation and understimulation.
-- Make appropriate referrals to available support groups, hobby clubs, or service organizations.

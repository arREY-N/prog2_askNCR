::Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome::

::Definition::
 A constellation of withdrawal symptoms observed in newborns as a result of in utero exposure to addicting substances, or as a consequence of postnatal pharmacological pain management.

[Nursing Priority No. 1]
    - To determine degree of impairment: 
1. Note maternal risks for fetal well-being including substance(s) used, dose, duration (especially last week before delivery), route; presence of infections. Maternal IV drug use associated with increased risk of infections (e.g., HIV, hep B, hep C) requiring additional testing/surveillance and treatment. Note: Maternal self-report of substance use may signifi cantly understate fetal exposure.
2. Note maternal risks for fetal well-being including substance(s) used, dose, duration (especially last week before delivery), route; presence of infections. Maternal IV drug use associated with increased risk of infections (e.g., HIV, hep B, hep C) requiring additional testing/surveillance and treatment. Note: Maternal self-report of substance use may signifi cantly understate fetal exposure.
3. Review maternal urine/drug screen. Individual more likely to use more than one substance complicating treatment. Use of opiates within 1 week of delivery causes withdrawal in over half of infants exposed prenatally. Note:  Symptoms and timing of occurrence depend on type ofsubstance(s) used and last dose.
4. Note fetal status—full-term or premature birth. Preterm infants have lower risk or less severe symptoms and tend to recover more quickly than full-term infant, if no other complications are present. Longer gestation with increased permeability of placental barrier can increase fetal exposure to drugs prior to delivery.
5. Obtain urine and/or meconium samples for toxicology screen. Urine sample refl ects last several days of exposure, while meconium is more sensitive with longer window of detection—from 20 weeks’ gestation.
6. Monitor for signs/symptoms of Fetal Abstinence Syndrome (FAS), such as excessive high-pitched cry, problems with sleep, feeding diffi culties, tremors, frequent yawning and sneezing, vomiting, and diarrhea. Onset of symptoms refl ecting dysregulation in central, autonomic, and gastrointestinal system function is varied based on substance(s) used, possibly appearing as early as 24 hours or delayed for 10 days, and require supportive interventions.
7. Screen neonate at birth using standardized tool such as Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring form. Repeat evaluation every 3 to 4 hours when infant awake. Baseline usedfor comparison of subsequent tests, with usually two or three consecutive scores of eight or above indicating need for pharmacological therapy. Scores assist in monitoring, titrating, and termination of therapy. Note: Scoring may not be useful in preterm infants as delayed central nervous system (CNS) development impacts score.

    -  To facilitate safe withdrawal from substance(s):
1. Coordinate/interact with interdisciplinary team (e.g., neonatologist, pediatrician, nutritionist). This addresses immediate needs of infant during withdrawal process.
2. Encourage rooming in as appropriate. Promotes attachment and greater maternal involvement in infant’s care, improves breastfeeding outcomes, may reduce need for pharmacological therapy, and shortens length of hospital stay.
3. Support breastfeeding efforts. Refer to lactation consultant as needed. Confers immunologic benefits to neonate, enhances bonding, and may lower Finnegan scores during fi rst nine days of life. Note: Not recommended in presence of HIV infection or presence of drug use, except in maternal methadone therapy.
4. Provide comfort measures based on individual needs (generally fi rst option in treatment and may be suffi cient in cases of mild withdrawal).
 - Swaddling in blanket provides containment boundaries and enhances sleep.
 - Kangaroo (skin-to-skin) care may enhance neurophysiological organization.
 - Gentle rocking of infant
 - Lower light and noise levels can minimize excess environmental stimuli.
 - Frequent, demand feedings 
 - Pacifi er for non-nutritive sucking
 - Water bed, but avoid oscillating bed
 - Avoid unnecessary handling or awakening sleeping infant.  
5. Monitor vital signs, intake/output, and weight. Poor feeding efforts, vomiting, and excessive diarrhea may result in dehydration.
6. Provide high-calorie (150 to 250 Kcal/Kg per 24 hr), small, more frequent feedings if infant is not breastfeeding. May be necessary to minimize weight loss and promote growth during signifi cant withdrawal. 
7. Provide meticulous skin care. Skin irritation from restlessness/agitation and excessive diarrhea requires careful cleaning and skin barrier creams to prevent breakdown.
8. Administer intravenous fluids (IV) as needed. May be required to prevent dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.
9.  Administer medication(s) for withdrawal when supportive measures fail to improve or correct symptoms, withdrawal scores remain high, seizures develop, or presence of severe dehydration, vomiting and/or diarrhea:
 - Morphine (i.e., dilute tincture of opium)—administered orally, most commonly preferred medication for treatment of opioid withdrawal
 - Methadone—alternative to morphine and may shorten length of opioid withdrawal
 - Buprenorphine—may have shorter duration and hospital stay than treatment with oral morphine, approved for outpatient/postdischarge therapy due to characteristics of decreased respiratory and cardiovascular side effects
 - Phenobarbital—preferred for treatment of nonopiate and polydrug exposure
 - Clonidine—second-line treatment for symptoms refractory to opioid therapy
10. Wean from medication as indicated. Once withdrawal scores decline and symptoms can be managed by comfort measures, a modifi ed protocol can be initiated to decrease pharmacological therapy. Note: Protocol can be extended for 3 weeks or more depending on infant’s needs.

    - To promote optimal wellness (Teaching/Discharge Considerations):
1. Interact with expanded interdisciplinary team to include substance abuse counselor, social worker, child development specialist, etc. Provides support for mother/family in preparation for discharge and future care needs of infant.
2. Develop trusting relationship, project an accepting attitude about substance use. Encourages maternal participation, provides client a sense of humanness, and helps to decrease paranoia and distrust. (Client will be able to detect biased or condescending attitude of caregivers, negatively impacting relationship.)
3. Determine parents’ understanding of current situation. Provides information about degree of denial, acceptance of personal responsibility, and commitment to change.
4. Provide information to parents in multiple modes, reviewing general infant care and long-term needs specifi c to substances used. For example: Methadone exposure associated with increased motor rigidity and dysregulated motor patterns can persist into toddlerhood with decreased attention span, impaired social responsibility with poor social engagement. Cocaine use can result in poor fetal growth, developmental delays, learning disabilities, and lower IQ.
5. Stress importance/develop schedule for follow-up monitoring. Necessary evaluations include neurodevelopmental assessments to monitor motor defi cits, cognitive delays, or relative microcephaly; psycho-behavioral assessments for hyperactivity, impulsivity, attention-defi cit in preschoolaged children, and behavioral problems in school-aged children; growth/nutritional assessment for short stature and failure to thrive.
6. Perform home visit to determine safety of environment. Optimum home environment required for global development and well-being of infant.
7. Encourage continued involvement of mother in peer group therapy, individual/family counseling, drug recovery education programs. Provides follow-up support to maintain mother’s sobriety.
8. Identify community/social assistance resources (e.g., safe housing, food pantry, licensed day care, transportation, medical care). Provides for basic human needs of infant and family, enhances maternal coping abilities, and decreases risk of relapse and possible abusive situation.

::Risk for Aspiration::

::Definition::
Susceptible to entry of gastrointestinal secretions,
oropharyngeal secretions, solids or fluids into the tracheobronchial passages, which may compromise health.

::Action/Interventions::

[Nursing Priority No. 1] 
    To assess causative/contributing factors:
1. Identify at-risk clients according to condition or disease process, as listed in Risk Factors, to determine when observation and/or interventions may be required.
2. Assess for age-related risk factors potentiating risk of aspiration (e.g., premature infant, elderly infirm). Aspiration pneumonia is more common in extremely young or old patients and commonly occurs in individuals with chronically impaired airway defense mechanisms.
3. Note the client’s level of consciousness, awareness of surroundings, and cognitive function, as impairments in these areas increase the client’s risk of aspiration owing to the inability to cough or swallow well and/or the presence of an artificial airway, mechanical ventilation, and/or tube feedings.
4. Determine the presence of neuromuscular disorders, noting muscle groups involved, degree of impairment, and whether they are of an acute or progressive nature (e.g., stroke, Parkinson’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and similar disabling brain diseases; Guillain-Barré syndrome, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). This may result in temporary or chronic, progressive impairment of protective muscle functions.
5. Assess the client’s ability to swallow and cough; note quality of voice. Sudden respiratory symptoms (e.g., severe coughing and cyanosis, wet phlegmy voice quality) are indicative of potential aspiration. Also, individuals with impaired or absent cough refl exes (such as may occur after a stroke, in Parkinson’s disease, or during sedation) are at high risk for “silent” aspiration.
6. Observe for neck and facial edema. A client with a head/neck surgery or a tracheal/bronchial injury (e.g., upper torso burns or inhalation/chemical injury) is at particular risk for airway obstruction and an inability to handle secretions.
7. Assess for coughing and note amount and consistency of respiratory secretions. Helps differentiate the potential cause for risk of aspiration.
8. Auscultate lung sounds periodically (especially in a client who is coughing frequently or not coughing at all; a client with artificial airways, endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes; or a ventilator client being tube-fed, immediately following extubation), and observe chest radiographs to determine decreased breath sounds, rales, or dullness to percussion that could indicate the presence of aspirated secretions, and “silent aspiration” leading to aspiration pneumonia.
9. Evaluate for/note presence of gastrointestinal (GI) pathology and motility disorders. Nausea with vomiting (associated with metabolic disorders, or following surgery, and with certain medications) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can cause inhalation of gastric contents.
10. Note the administration of enteral feedings, which may be initiated when oral nutrition is not possible. The potential exists for regurgitation and aspiration with the use of nasogastric feeding tubes, even with proper tube placement.
11. Ascertain lifestyle habits (e.g., chronic use of alcohol and drugs, alcohol intoxication, tobacco, and other central nervous system [CNS] suppressant drugs). These can affect awareness as well as impair gag and swallow mechanisms.
12. Assist with/review diagnostic studies (e.g., videofluoroscopy or fiberoptic endoscopy), which may be done to assess for presence/degree of impairment.

    To assist in correcting factors that can lead to aspiration:
1. Elevate the client to the highest or best possible position (e.g., sitting upright in chair) for eating and drinking and during tube feedings. Adults and children should be upright for meals to decrease the likelihood of drainage into the trachea and to reduce refl ux and improve gastric emptying.
2. Encourage the client to cough, as able, to clear secretions. The client may simply need to be reminded or encouraged to cough (such as might occur in an elderly person with delayed gag refl ex or in a postoperative, sedated client).
3. Monitor the use of oxygen masks in clients at risk for vomiting. Refrain from using oxygen masks for comatose individuals.
4. Keep wire cutters/scissors with the client at all times when jaws are wired/banded to facilitate clearing the airway in emergency situations.
5. Assist with oral care, postural drainage, and other respiratory therapies to remove or mobilize thickened secretions that may interfere with swallowing and block airway.
6. In client requiring suctioning to manage secretions :
 - Maintain operational suction equipment at bedside/chairside. Suction (oral cavity, nose, and endotracheal/tracheostomy tube), as needed, and avoid triggering the gag mechanism when performing suction or mouth care to clear secretions while reducing the potential for aspiration of secretions.
 - Avoid keeping the client supine/fl at when on mechanical ventilation (especially when also receiving enteral feedings).
 - Supine positioning and enteral feedings have been shown to be independent risk factors for the development of aspiration pneumonia.
 - Perform scrupulous oral care to prevent the accumulation of thickened secretions in the oral pharynx and to remove secretions that may interfere with the movement of air.
7. For a verified swallowing problem :
- Provide a rest period prior to feeding time. The rested client may have less difficulty with swallowing.
- Feed slowly, using small bites, instructing the client to chew slowly and thoroughly.
- Vary the placement of food in the client’s mouth according to type of swallowing deficit (e.g., place food in right side of mouth if facial weakness is present on the left side).
- Provide soft foods that stick together/form a bolus (e.g., casseroles, puddings, or stews) to aid the swallowing effort.
- Determine liquid viscosity best tolerated by client. Add thickening agent to liquids, as appropriate. Some individuals may swallow thickened liquids better than thin liquids.
- Offer very warm or very cold liquids. This activates temperature receptors in the mouth that help to stimulate swallowing.
- Avoid washing solids down with liquids to prevent bolus of food pushing down too rapidly, increasing risk of aspiration.
8. When feeding tube is in place :
- Ascertain that the feeding tube (when used) is in the correct position. Placement may be done under fl uoroscopy, and/or measurement of aspirate pH following placement of feeding tube may be indicated . Ask the client about feeling of fullness and/or measure residuals (just prior to feeding and several hours after feeding), when appropriate, to reduce risk of aspiration.
- Determine the best resting position for infant/child (e.g., with the head of the bed elevated 30 degrees and the infant propped on the right side after feeding). Upper airway patency is facilitated by an upright position, and turning to the right side decreases the likelihood of drainage into the trachea.
- Provide oral medications in elixir form or crush, if appropriate.
- Minimize the use of sedatives/hypnotics whenever possible. These agents can impair coughing and swallowing.
- Refer to physician and/or speech/language therapist for medical or surgical interventions and/or exercises to strengthen muscles and learn specifi c techniques to enhance swallowing/reduce potential aspiration.

[Nursing Priority No.3]
    To promote wellness (Teaching/Discharge Considerations):
1. Review with client/significant other individual risk or potentiating factors.
2. Provide information about the signs and effects of aspiration on the lungs. Severe coughing and cyanosis (associated with eating or drinking) or changes in vocal quality after swallowing indicate onset of respiratory symptoms associated with aspiration and require immediate intervention.
3. Instruct in safety concerns regarding oral or tube feeding. (Refer to ND impaired Swallowing.)
4. Train the client how to self-suction or train family members in suction techniques (especially if the client has constant or copious oral secretions) to enhance safety/self-suffi ciency.
5. Instruct the individual/family member to avoid or limit activities after eating that increase intra-abdominal pressure (straining, strenuous exercise, or tight/constrictive clothing), which may slow digestion/increase risk of regurgitation.

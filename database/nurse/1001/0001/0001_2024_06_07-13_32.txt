::Activity Intolerance/risk for Activity Intolerance::

::Definition::
Activity Intolerance: Insufficient physiological or psychological energy to endure or complete required or desired daily activities.
risk for Activity Intolerance: Susceptible to experiencing insufficient physiological or psychological energy to endure or complete required or desired daily activities, which may compromise health. 

::Action/Interventions::
[Nursing Priority No. 1]
To identify causative/precipitating or risk factors: 
1. Note presence of acute or chronic illness, such as heart failure, pulmonary disorders, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, AIDS, anemias, cancers, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and acute and chronic pain. Many factors can cause or contribute to fatigue, having potential to interfere with client’s ability to perform at a desired level of activity. However, the term “activity intolerance” implies that the client cannot endure or adapt to increased energy or oxygen demands caused by an activity. (Refer to ND Fatigue.)
2. Ask client/significant other (SO) about usual level of energy to identify potential problems and/or client’s/SO’s perception of client’s energy and ability to perform needed or desired activities.
3. Evaluate the client’s actual and perceived limitations and severity of deficit in light of usual status. This provides a comparative baseline and information about needed education or interventions regarding quality of life.
4. Identify factors, such as age, functional decline, client resistive to efforts, painful conditions, breathing problems, vision or hearing impairments, climate or weather, unsafe areas to exercise, and need for mobility assistance that could block/affect the desired level of activity.
5. Note client reports of weakness, fatigue, pain, difficulty accomplishing tasks, and/or insomnia. Symptoms may be a result of or contribute to intolerance of activity.
6. Assess cardiopulmonary response to physical activity, including vital signs, before, during, and after activity. Note accelerating fatigue. Dramatic changes in heart rate and rhythm, changes in usual blood pressure, and progressively worsening fatigue result from an imbalance of oxygen supply and demand.
7. Ascertain the client’s ability to stand and move about and the degree of assistance necessary or use of equipment to determine current status and needs associated with participation in needed/desired activities.
8. Identify activity needs versus desires to evaluate appropriateness (e.g., is barely able to walk upstairs but would like to play tennis).
9. Assess emotional and psychological factors affecting the current situation (e.g., stress and/or depression may be increasing the effects of an illness, or depression might be the result of forced inactivity).
10. Note treatment-related factors, such as side effects and interactions of medications, which can affect the nature and degree of activity intolerance.
11.  Determine the client’s current activity level and physical condition with observation, exercise-capacity testing, or use of a functional-level classification system (e.g., Gordon’s), as appropriate. This provides a baseline for comparison and an opportunity to track changes.
[Nursing Priority No. 2]
To assist client to deal with contributing factors and manage activities within individual limits (Activity Intolerance): 
1. Monitor vital and cognitive signs, watching for changes in blood pressure, heart, and respiratory rates; note skin pallor and/or cyanosis and presence of confusion.
2. Reduce intensity level or discontinue activities that cause undesired physiological changes to prevent overexertion.
3. Provide and monitor response to supplemental oxygen, medications, and changes in treatment regimen.
4. Increase exercise/activity levels gradually; teach methods to conserve energy, such as stopping to rest for 3 min during a 10-min walk or sitting down to brush hair instead of standing.
5. Plan care to carefully balance rest periods with activities to reduce fatigue.
6. Provide positive atmosphere while acknowledging the difficulty of the situation for the client. This helps to minimize frustration and rechannel energy.
7. Encourage expression of feelings contributing to or resulting from the condition.
8. Involve client/SO(s) in planning activities as much as possible.
9. Assist with activities and provide/monitor client’s use of assistive devices (e.g., crutches, walker, wheelchair, or oxygen tank) to protect client from injury.
10. Promote comfort measures and provide for relief of pain to enhance ability to participate in activities. (Refer to NDs acute Pain; chronic Pain.)
11. Provide referral to other disciplines, such as exercise physiologist, psychological counseling/therapy, occupational/physical therapists, and recreation/leisure specialists, as indicated, to develop individually appropriate therapeutic regimens.
[Nursing Priority No. 3]
To develop alternative ways to remain active within the limits of the disabling condition/situation (risk for Activity Intolerance):
1 Implement a physical therapy/exercise program in conjunction with the client and other team members (e.g., physical and/or occupational therapist, exercise/rehabilitation physiologist). A collaborative program with short-term achievable goals enhances the likelihood of success and may motivate the client to adopt a lifestyle of physical exercise for the enhancement of health.
2. Promote and implement a conditioning program. Support inclusion in exercise and activity groups to prevent/limit deterioration.
3. Instruct client in proper performance of unfamiliar activities and in alternate ways of doing familiar activities to conserve energy and promote safety

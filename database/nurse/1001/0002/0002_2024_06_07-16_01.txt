::Risk For Shock::

::Definition::
 Susceptible to an inadequate blood flow to the body’s tissues that may lead to life-threatening cellular dysfunction, which may compromise health. 

::Action/Interventions::
[Nursing Priority No. 1]
    -  To assess causative/contributing factors:
1. Note possible medical diagnoses or disease processes that can result in one or more types of shock, such as major trauma with heavy internal or external bleeding; heart failure; head or spinal cord injury; allergic reactions; pregnancy-related complications; intra abdominal infections, open wounds, or other conditions associated with sepsis. 
2. Assess for history or presence of conditions leading to hypovolemic shock , such as trauma, surgery, inadequate clotting, anticoagulant therapy; gastrointestinal or other organ hemorrhage; prolonged vomiting and diarrhea; diabetes insipidus; misuse of diuretics. These conditions deplete the body’s circulating blood volume and ability to maintain organ perfusion and function.
3. Assess for conditions associated with cardiogenic shock, including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, lethal ventricular dysrhythmias, severe valvular dysfunction, cardiomyopathies, malignant hypertension. These conditions directly impair the heart muscle and ability to pump.
4. Assess for conditions associated with obstructive shock, including pulmonary embolus, aortic stenosis, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax. In these conditions, the heart itself may be healthy but cannot pump because of conditions outside the heart that prevent normal fi lling or adequate outfl ow. 
5. Assess for conditions associated with distributive shock— neural induced, including pain, anesthesia, spinal cord or head injury; or chemical induced, including peritonitis, sepsis, burns, anaphylaxis, hyperglycemia. These situations result in loss of sympathetic tone, blood vessel dilation, pooling of venous blood, and increased capillary permeability with shifting of fl uids.
6. Monitor for persistent or heavy fl uid loss, including wounds, drains, vomiting, gastrointestinal tube, chest tube. Check all secretions and excretions for occult blood. Refer to NDs risk for Bleeding; defi cient Fluid Volume, risk for imbalanced Fluid Volume (for additional interventions).
7. Inspect skin, noting presence of traumatic or surgical wounds, erythema, edema, tenderness, petechiae; rashes or hives for evidence of hemorrhage, localized infections, or hypersensitivity reaction.
8. Investigate reports of increased or sudden pain in wounds or body parts, which could indicate ischemia or infection.
9. Be aware of invasive devices, such as urinary and intravascular catheters, endotrachial tube, implanted prosthetic devices that potentiate risk for localized and systemic infections.
10. Assess vital signs and tissue and organ perfusion for changes associated with shock states:
 - Heart rate and rhythm—noting progressive changes in heart rate (refl ecting an attempt to increase cardiac output) and development of dysrhythmias, suggesting electrolyte imbalances, hypoxia.
 - Respirations—noting rapid, shallow breathing, use of accessory muscles (in an attempt to increase vital capacity and compensate for metabolic acidosis associated with poor tissue perfusion and anaerobic metabolism),
 - which can progress to respiratory failure. Blood pressure—noting hypotension, postural hypotension, and narrowed pulse pressure. May indicate hypovolemia and/or failure of cardiac pumping or compensatory mechanisms.
 - Pulses and neck veins—noting rapid, weak, thready peripheral pulses; congested or fl at neck veins. Signs associated with changes in circulating volume, cardiac ouput, and progressive changes in vascular tone and/or capillary permeability.
 - Temperature—higher than 100.4°F (38°C) or lower than 96.8°F (36°C) may indicate infectious process. Temperature changes in presence of elevated heart and respiratory rate, along with mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count in absence of documented infection, is suggestive of systemic infl ammatory response.
 - State of consciousness and mentation—noting anxiety, restlessness, confusion, lethargy, or unresponsiveness. Can occur because of changes in oxygenation, acid-base imbalances, and toxins associated with hypoperfusion.
 - Skin color and moisture—noting overall fl ushing or pallor; bluish lips and fi ngernails, slow capillary refi ll; or cool, clammy skin.
 - Urine output—noting substantially decreased ouput. One of the most sensitive indicators of change in circulating volume or poor perfusion.
 - Urine characteristics—noting color and odor suggestive of infection source.
 - Bowel sounds—noting diminished or absent bowel sounds; other changes in gastrointestinal function such as vomiting; or change in color, amount, or frequency of stools, refl ecting hypoperfusion of gastrointestinal tract.
11. Measure invasive hemodynamic parameters when available—central venous pressure (CVP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO)— to determine if intravascular fl uid defi cit or cardiac dysfunction exists.
12. Obtain specimens of wounds, drains, central lines, blood for culture and sensitivity.
13. Review laboratory data such as complete blood count with WBCs and differential; platelet numbers and function; other coagulation factors; tests for cardiac, renal, and hepatic function; pulse oximetry/arterial blood gas; serum lactate, blood urine cultures to identify potential sources of shock and degree of organ involvement.
14. Review diagnostic studies such as x-rays, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, angiography with ejection fraction, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans, ultrasound to determine presence of injuries or disorders that could cause or lead to shock conditions.
[Nursing Priority No. 2]
    - To prevent/correct potential causes of shock:
1. Collaborate in prompt treatment of underlying conditions such as trauma, heart failure, infections, and prepare for/ assist with medical and surgical interventions to maximize systemic circulation and tissue and organ perfusion.
2. Administer oxygen by appropriate route (e.g., nasal prongs, mask, ventilator) to maximize oxygenation of tissues.
3. Administer fluids, electrolytes, colloids, blood or blood products, as indicated, to rapidly restore or sustain circulating volume, electrolyte balance, and prevent shock state.
4. Administer medications as indicated (e.g., vasoactive drugs, cardiac glycosides, thrombolytics, anticoagulants, antimicrobials, analgesics). 
5. Provide client care with infection prevention interventions, such as diligent attention to hand hygiene, aseptic wound care or dressing changes, isolation precautions, early intervention in potential infectious condition to reduce incidence or progression of infection.
6. Provide nutrition by best means—oral, enteral, or parenteral feeding. Refer to nutritionist or dietitian to provide foods rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals needed to promote healing and support immune system health.
7. Refer to NDs ineffective peripheral Tissue Perfusion; risk for decreased cardiac Tissue Perfusion; risk for ineffective cerebral Tissue Perfusion, for additional interventions and rationales. 
[Nursing Priority No.3]
    -  Promote wellness (Teaching/Discharge Considerations):
1. Instruct client/SO in ways to prevent and/or manage underlying conditions that cause shock, including heart disease, injuries, dehydration, infection. 
2. Identify reportable signs and symptoms, including unrelieved pain, unresolved bleeding, excessive fl uid loss, persistent fever and chills, change in skin color accompanied by chest pain for timely evaluation and intervention.
3. Emphasize need for recognition of substances that cause hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (e.g., insects, medicines, foods, latex) to reduce risk of anaphylactic shock state. 
4. Teach client purpose, dosage, schedule, precautions, and potential side effects of medications given to treat underlying conditions. Enhances compliance with drug regimen, reducing individual risk.
5. Instruct in wound and skin care as indicated to prevent infection and promote healing.
6. Teach client/caregivers importance of good hand hygiene, clean environment, and avoiding crowds when ill, especially if client is immunocompromised.
7. Reinforce importance of immunization against infections such as infl uenza and pneumonia, especially in client with chronic conditions.
8. Encourage consumption of healthy diet, participation in regular exercise, and adequate rest for healing and immune system support.
9. Recommend that client at risk for hypersensitivity reactions wear medical alert bracelet, maintain readily accessible emergency medication (e.g., Benadryl and/or EpiPen).

::Anxiety: mild, moderate, severe, panic::

::Definition::
Vague uneasy feeling of discomfort or dread accompanied by an autonomic response (the source is often nonspecific or unknown to the individual); a feeling of apprehension caused by anticipation of danger. It is an alerting sign that warns of impending danger and enables the individual to take measures to deal with that threat.

::Action/Interventions::
[Nursing Priority No. 1]
To assess level of anxiety:
1. Review familial and physiological factors (e.g., genetic depressive factors), psychiatric illness, active medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, metabolic imbalances, cardiopulmonary disease, anemia, or dysrhythmias), and recent/ongoing stressors (e.g., family member illness or death, spousal confl ict/abuse, or loss of job). These factors can cause/exacerbate anxiety and anxiety disorders.
2. Determine current prescribed medications and recent drug history of prescribed or over-the-counter (OTC) medications (e.g., steroids, thyroid preparations, weight loss pills, or caffeine). These medications can heighten feelings and sense of anxiety.
3. Identify the client’s perception of the threat represented by the situation. Distorted perceptions of the situation may magnify feelings. Understanding client’s point of view promotes a more accurate plan of care.
4. Note cultural factors that may infl uence anxiety. Individual responses are infl uenced by cultural values and beliefs and culturally learned patterns of their family of origin.
5. Monitor vital signs (e.g., rapid or irregular pulse, rapid breathing/hyperventilation, changes in blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremors, or restlessness) to identify physical responses associated with both medical and emotional conditions.
6. Observe behaviors that can point to the client’s level of anxiety:
[Mild]
-- Alert, more aware of environment, attention focused on environment and immediate events
-- Restless; irritable; wakeful; reports of insomnia
-- Motivated to deal with existing problems in this state
[Moderate]
-- Perception narrower, concentration increased, able to ignore distractions in dealing with problem(s)
-- Voice quivers or changes pitch
-- Trembling, increased pulse/respirations
- Severe
-- Range of perception is reduced, anxiety interferes with effective functioning
-- Preoccupied with feelings of discomfort, sense of impending doom
-- Increased pulse/respirations with reports of dizziness, tingling
sensations, headaches, and so forth
[Panic]
-- The ability to concentrate is disrupted; behavior is disintegrated; and the client distorts the situation and does not have realistic perceptions of what is happening. The client may be experiencing terror or confusion or be unable to speak or move (paralyzed with fear).
- Note reports of insomnia or excessive sleeping, limited/avoidance of interactions with others, and use of alcohol or other drugs that can be abused, which may be behavioral indicators of use of withdrawal to deal with problems.
- Review results of diagnostic tests (e.g., drug screens, cardiac testing, complete blood count, and chemistry panel), which may point to physiological sources of anxiety.
- Be aware of defense mechanisms being used (e.g., denial or regression) that interfere with ability to deal with problem.
- Identify coping skills the individual is currently using, such as anger, daydreaming, forgetfulness, overeating, smoking, or lack of problem solving.
- Review coping skills used in the past to determine those that might be helpful in current circumstances.
[Nursing Priority No. 2]
To assist client with identifying feelings and beginning to deal with problems:
1. Establish a therapeutic relationship, conveying empathy and unconditional positive regard. Note : The nurse needs to be aware of his or her own feelings of anxiety or uneasiness, exercising care to avoid the contagious effect or transmission of anxiety.
2. Be available to the client for listening and talking. Establishes rapport, promotes expression of feelings, and helps client/signifi cant other look at realities of the illness or treatment without confronting issues they are not ready to deal with.
3. Encourage the client to acknowledge and to express feelings,
such as crying (sadness), laughing (fear or denial), or swearing (fear or anger).
4. Assist the client in developing self-awareness of verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Becoming aware helps client to control these behaviors and begin to deal with issues that are causing anxiety.
5. Clarify the meanings of feelings and actions by providing feedback and checking meaning with the client.
6. Acknowledge anxiety/fear. Do not deny or reassure client that everything will be all right. Validates reality of feelings. False reassurances may be interpreted as lack of understanding or dishonesty, further isolating client.
7. Provide accurate information about the situation. This helps the client identify what is reality based.
8. Be truthful, avoid bribing, and provide physical comfort (e.g., hugging or rocking) when dealing with a child to soothe fears and provide assurance.
9. Provide comfort measures (e.g., calm/quiet environment, soft music, a warm bath, or a back rub).
10. Modify procedures as much as possible (e.g., substitute oral for intramuscular medications or combine blood draws/use finger-stick method) to limit the degree of stress and avoid overwhelming a child or anxious adult.
11 Manage environmental factors, such as harsh lighting and high traffic flow, which may be confusing and stressful to older individuals.
12. Accept the client as is. The client may need to be where he or she is at this point in time, such as in denial after receiving the diagnosis of a terminal illness.
13. Allow the behavior to belong to the client; do not respond personally. The nurse may respond inappropriately, escalating the situation to a nontherapeutic interaction.
14. Assist the client to use anxiety for coping with the situation, if helpful. Moderate anxiety heightens awareness and permits the client to focus on dealing with problems.
5. Panic
-- Stay with client, maintaining a calm, confi dent manner.
- Speak in brief statements using simple words.
- Provide for nonthreatening, consistent environment/atmosphere. Minimize stimuli. Monitor visitors and interactions
to lessen the effect of transmission of feelings.
- Set limits on inappropriate behavior and help the client to
develop acceptable ways of dealing with anxiety.
NOTE: Staff may need to provide safe controls and environment
until client regains control.
- Gradually increase activities/involvement with others as
anxiety is decreased.
- Use cognitive therapy to focus on or correct faulty catastrophic interpretations of physical symptoms.
- Administer medications (anti-anxiety agents/sedatives), as
ordered. 
[Nursing Priority No.3]
    To provide measures to comfort and aid client to handle problematic situations:
1. Provide comfort measures (e.g., calm or quiet environment, soft music, warm bath, back rub, Therapeutic Touch). Aids in meeting basic human need, decreasing sense of isolation, and assisting client to feel less anxious. 
2. Modify procedures as necessary (e.g., substitute oral for intramuscular medications, combine blood draws or use finger-stick method). Limits degree of stress and avoids overwhelming child or anxious adult.
3. Accept client as is. The client may need to be where he or she is at this point in time, such as in denial after receiving the diagnosis of a terminal illness.
4. Allow the behavior to belong to the client; do not respond personally.
5. Assist client to use anxiety for coping with the situation if helpful. Moderate anxiety heightens awareness and can help client to focus on dealing with problems.
6. Encourage awareness of negative self-talk and discuss replacing with positive statements, such as using “can” instead of “can’t,” etc.
  -- To promote wellness (Teaching/Discharge Considerations):
    1. Assist the client in identifying precipitating factors and new methods of coping with disabling anxiety.
    2. Review happenings, thoughts, and feelings preceding the anxiety attack.
    3. Identify actions and activities the client has previously used to cope successfully when feeling nervous/anxious.
    4. List helpful resources and people, including available “hotline” or crisis managers to provide ongoing/timely support.
    5. Encourage the client to develop an exercise/activity program, which may serve to reduce the level of anxiety by relieving tension.
    6. Assist in developing skills (e.g., awareness of negative thoughts, saying “Stop,” and substituting a positive thought) to eliminate negative self-talk. Mild phobias tend to respond well to behavioral therapy.
    7. Review strategies, such as role-playing, use of visualizations to practice anticipated events, and prayer/meditation. This is useful for being prepared for/dealing with anxietyprovoking situations.
    8. Review medication regimen and possible interactions, especially with OTC drugs, other prescription drugs, and alcohol. Discuss appropriate drug substitutions, changes in dosage, or time of dose to minimize side effects.
    9. Refer to the physician for drug management alteration of the prescription regimen. Drugs that often cause symptoms of anxiety include aminophylline/theophylline, anticholinergics, dopamine, levodopa, salicylates, and steroids.
    10. Refer to individual and/or group therapy, as appropriate, to deal with chronic anxiety states.
